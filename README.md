<h1>LSTM for Time series</h1>
<p>An experiment on using a LSTM model for time series for learning purposes only. I used the PRSA dataset for Beijing pollution. This LSTM recurrnet model has 23 time steps.</p>
<p>the following graph decsribes the predicted vs the the actual. Note that only the next value has been predicted</p>
